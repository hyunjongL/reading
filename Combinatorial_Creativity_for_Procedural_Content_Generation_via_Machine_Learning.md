Matthew Guzdial and Mark O. Riedl

Computational Creativity is what they are working on.  
They are trying to use combinatorial creativity techniques to machine learned models, learned from games.  

## Related Works
- CBR(Case Based Reasoning: domain dependent for text gen or tool creation. Murdock&Goel combines RL with CBR, which is similar with them trying to combine ML with Computational Creativity
- Other combinatorial techniques: Belief Merging - it has only one final output

We will identify 3 combinatorial creativity techniques
